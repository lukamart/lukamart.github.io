## Brief Biography
I received the B.S. and Spec.Sci. degrees in Power and Control Systems from the University of Montenegro in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The title of my Senior Thesis was "State Estimation in Sensor Networks via Distributed Kalman Filter", in the Control Systems Department. In July 2021, I defended the thesis "A Novel Distributed Algorithm for Control of Multi-Agent Systems", thereby obtaining a M.S./MEng degree in the same department. Currently I am enrolled in a PhD program where I work on distributed synchronization and output regulation problems in multi-agent systems.

Since September of 2019, I am employed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, where I work as a teaching assistant. Some of the main courses that I have TAed are: Control Theory, Optimal Control, Adaptive Control, Digital Control and Robotics.
